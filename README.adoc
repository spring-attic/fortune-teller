= Fortune Teller

*Fortune Teller* is a very basic application composed of two services:

. link:fortune-teller-fortune-service[Fortune Service] - serves up random Chinese fortune cookie fortunes
. link:fortune-teller-ui[Fortune UI] - presents a UI that consumes the fortune service

It leverages libraries and services from Spring Cloud and Netflix OSS to compose the system.

Fortune Teller is deployable to any Cloud Foundry environment utilizing the service components that have been packaged with the project.
However, it is most easily deployed to Pivotal Cloud Foundry environments that have installed the https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-spring-cloud-services[Spring Cloud Services] package.

== Building

. Using Maven, build and package the application:
+
----
$ mvn package
----
+
Maven will automatically download all of _Fortune Teller_'s dependencies. This may take a few moments.


== Deploying to Pivotal Cloud Foundry with Spring Cloud Services

. Run `scripts/create-services.sh` to create the services that you need:
+
----
$ ./create_services_pcf.sh
Creating service fortune-db in org microservices / space fortune-teller as admin...
OK
Creating service config-service in org microservices / space fortune-teller as admin...
OK
Creating service service-registry in org microservices / space fortune-teller as admin...
OK
Creating service circuit-breaker in org microservices / space fortune-teller as admin...
OK
----

. In the Pivotal Cloud Foundry App Manager console, click on the *Manage* links for the *Config Server*. Once the service is initialized and the web form appears, paste https://github.com/mstine/config-repo into the *Git URI* field and click *Submit*.

. Also click on the *Manage* links for the *Service Registry* and *Circuit Breaker*. Make sure the services are finished initializing before you proceed.

. Push the microservices:
+
----
$ cf push -f manifest-pcf.yml
----
+
This will push the fortunes service and the ui application and bind all of the services.

== Deploying to Pivotal Web Services (or other Cloud Foundry environments)

. Push the Spring Cloud services:
+
----
$ cf push -f manifest-services.yml
----
+
This will push a Spring Cloud Config Server, a Eureka server, and a Hystrix Dashboard, all with random routes.

. Run `./scripts/provision_services.sh` to register these services and provision a Postgres database:
+
----
$ scripts/provision_services.sh
Provisioning service registry, config server and database as backing services

Creating user provided service config-service in org Example / space Example as user@company.com...
OK

Registering service registry application instance 'eureka-example.cfapps.io' as a backing service
Creating user provided service service-registry in org Example / space Example as user@company.com...
OK

Provisioning PostgreSQL database
Creating service fortune-db in org Example / space Example as user@company.com...
OK
----

. Push the microservices:
+
----
$ cf push -f manifest-apps.yml
----
+
This will push the fortune-service and the fortune-ui application.

. Check the application routes created for your new microservices:
+
----
$ cf apps
----
+
This will show the custom URLs to access your fortune-ui web application and Hystrix dashboard.

== Testing the Application

. In a browser, access the fortunes-ui application at the route that was created for you:
+

. Now, in another browser tab, access the Hystrix Dashboard at the route that was created for you.
Enter the route for the fortune-ui application and click the ``Monitor Stream.'' 
+
NOTE: On Pivotal Cloud Foundry, you can access a pre-configured Hystrix Dashboard by clicking on the *Manage* link for *Circuit Breaker Dashboard*. You will *NOT* need to paste in the route. 
+

Note to modify this to your custom fortune-ui URL including a leading 'http://'' and trailing '/hystrix.stream'.

. Access the fortunes-ui and show that the circuit breaker is registering successful requests.
+
image:docs/images/fortunes_3.png[]

. Stop the fortunes application:
+
----
$ cf stop fortunes
----

. Access the fortunes-ui and see that the ``fallback fortune'' is being returned.
+

. Access the fortunes-ui and show that the circuit breaker is registering short-circuited requests.
+
image:docs/images/fortunes_5.png[]

. Start the fortunes application:
+
----
$ cf start fortunes
----

. Continue to access the fortunes-ui and watch the dashboard.
After the fortunes service has re-registered with Eureka and the fortunes-ui load balancer caches are refreshed, you will see the circuit breaker recover.
You should then start getting random fortunes again!

== Teardown
When you're done with the application, you can quickly delete the Fortune Teller application instances and services by running ./scripts/teardown.sh
